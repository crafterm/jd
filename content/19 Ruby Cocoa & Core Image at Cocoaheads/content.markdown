Last night saw our first Melbourne Cocoaheads meet up for the year. An awesome night was had by all, there were several talks given by various people including myself about RubyCocoa & Core Image, XCode Organiser, Python, and the iPhone.

I gave a presentation about Ruby Cocoa and some of the Core Image related research I had been working on to [integrate](http://redartisan.com/2007/12/12/attachment-fu-with-core-image) it into Attachment Fu for processing file uploads in Rails applications. I've [uploaded](http://www.slideshare.net/crafterm/ruby-cocoa-and-core-image/) the slides from my talk if anyone is interested in them.
