A few months ago we held a Ruby/Rails newbie night in Melbourne, I presented several talks on the night. Thanks to [Marty Andrews](http://www.martyandrews.net/blog/) the talks were [recorded](http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/screencasts/index.html) and are available.

Here are two of the talks I presented, one about Rails' use of convention over configuration:

<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/a77948b5/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/a77948b5/" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" name="viddler" ></embed></object>

and a further talk about Active Record's validations:

<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/dda25f44/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/dda25f44/" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" name="viddler" ></embed></object>
