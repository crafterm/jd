Arriving back in Melbourne, after having such a fantastic trip through Europe to attend RailsConf, visit clients and travel, it was great to see everyone at our local user group again at the end of last month.

I gave a quick presentation covering all the fun we all had at [RailsConf](http://redartisan.com/2007/9/19/railsconf-eu) while away.

It was particularly cool being able to talk about the excitement and atmosphere at the conference, and also at [RejectConf](http://redartisan.com/2007/9/22/rejectconf-europe-2007) which was once again a highlight of the trip.

In just under three weeks we'll be hosting [RailsCamp](http://wiki.railscamp07.org/railscamp07/) in Melbourne, which I'm also looking forward to. The previous camp held in Gosford was a blast, and I'm excited to see it happening again!
