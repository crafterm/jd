A few weeks ago I presented at the local
[Cocoaheads](http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/) here in Melbourne,
about UIScrollView's, and the various trials & tribulations I've had
working with them in the past.

The talk was structured with a story first about how UIScrollViews
have mystified us over the years, then a set of 10 demos, which were
contained within a single 'photo viewer' style project, using git
branches to successively add a feature that exhibited some scroll view
issue, and then add the fix with a discussion.

A friend of mine [Oliver](http://deeperdesign.wordpress.com/) recorded
the talk on his iPhone 4, and has since made it
[available](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i50Z5RPFTnc) on
YouTube. The quality is great considering its an iPhone 4, but please
 understand its not quite the level you'd see from WWDC.

I really enjoyed giving the talk. The aim was to help anyone venturing
into similar grounds with UIScrollView to recognize those issues and
be armed with solutions to them. Enjoy.
