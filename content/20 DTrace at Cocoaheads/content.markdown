Last night we had our monthly [Melbourne Cocoaheads](http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/) meetup which was great. There were several talks given including one about the [AUC](http://auc.uow.edu.au/), and I also gave a talk about [DTrace](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/), the popular dynamic tracing framework for Mac OS X Leopard and OpenSolaris.

I've uploaded the slides from my talk to slideshare for those interested - since most of the talk was a demo there are only a few slides included, however the links towards the end of the presentation provide some good references to more information about DTrace, the D language and using DTrace on your system.
