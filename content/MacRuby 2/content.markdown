MacRuby Building Desktop Apps


Twitter Client
  - IB for layout
  - MGTwitterEngine for accessing tweets or twitter gem (will it load)?
  - MGScopeBar for recent, all, friends, etc (need IB plugin to be nice)
  - Ruby for glue and logic
  - Bindings for UI glue and NSArray/Object/Controller
  - 

Or another idea?
  - Photos processor?
    - ImageKit
    - CoreImage filters, etc?
  - Integrate with tweets?
  - Ruby for glue, models, bindings

Keep thinking
