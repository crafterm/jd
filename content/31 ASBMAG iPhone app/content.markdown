Its great to see an application you've been working on recently be
accepted and made available on the Apple iTunes store.

Just last week, we
[released](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asbmag/id371966880?mt=8) the
[Australasian Surf Business Magazine](http://www.asbmag.com) (asbmag)
iPhone application!

*asbmag*'s application, targeted at those working within the surf industry,
allows you to keep up to date with the latest industry news and job content
on the iPhone, normally available on their website.

The design of the application has been to focus on the user's experience
while reading content on the phone, and integrate with the native
capabilities of the device.

Content is locally in Core Data so that the application works well
offline. When online, it efficiently retrieves the latest news and job
articles from [www.asbmag.com](http://www.asbmag.com) via an atom feed, and
appropriately updates the device.

If you're keen to keep up with what's happening in the Surf Industry,
[download](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asbmag/id371966880?mt=8) the
app for free and enjoy!
