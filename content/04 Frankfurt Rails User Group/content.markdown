Last night I met with the local Frankfurt Rails [User Group](http://rug-rheinmain.de/) developers. It was an awesome night, with lots of fun and laughter had by all. I always find it interesting to meet new people and hear what they've been doing with Ruby and Rails.

I also gave a few presentations about [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/) and [RSpec](http://rspec.rubyforge.org/), the slides are available for anyone interested:

[RSpec handout](/assets/2007/9/12/rspec_handout.pdf)

Many thank to [Mariano](http://claudia-und-mariano.net/) for hosting the event, and also a special thanks to Claudia for catering! :)

Today I'm traveling up to Berlin for the next part of my trip, RailsConf Europe. looking forward to meeting up with so many fellow Rails developers in the coming week!
