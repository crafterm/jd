Arrived in Berlin yesterday, and will be here for a week covering this coming weekend and RailsConf EU. Berlin is such an interesting and cool city, with so much history, vibe and culture surrounding it, it's going to be an awesome week. We spent the day touring various museums and historical places in town including Checkpoint Charlie, Potsdamer Platz and various others in between.

I've also noticed an abundance of very slick looking coffee shops in Berlin, most of them also offering free wireless internet access (like the one I'm right now), they'd make for quite a nice office :)

The first RailsConf EU event starts on Sunday night, [Bratwurst on Rails](http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com/), at the Kalkscheune, which I'm very much looking forward to. More RailsConf EU posts to come soon! :)

After Berlin, it's back to Frankfurt and then on to Munich for a few days before returning to Weimar again.
