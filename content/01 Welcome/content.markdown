Welcome to the Red Artisan weblog!

My name is Marcus Crafter, and I'm the founder and principal consultant at Red Artisan Pty Ltd. Red Artisan is an Australian based web site consultancy firm that specialises in building state of the art web 2.0 sites that rock.

Red Artisan uses [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and agile development principles to provide the highest level of quality and speed of development for clients. Ruby on Rails is a next generation web framework that allows developers to build expressive and elegant software quickly by allowing them to focus on the important aspects of your business rather than the framework. For clients this more value for money, translating into faster time to market, and increased productivity.

In the future, I'll be publishing various articles, posts, and pieces of information about the various technologies and principles Red Artisan believes in.
