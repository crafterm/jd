<h2>About</h2>

<p><strong>Red Artisan is passionate about the development of elegant, boutique and compelling software experiences.</strong></p>

<p>We specialise in the creation of exceptional Web and iPhone applications, with a focus on quality, elegance and performance in design and implementation.</p>

<p>We use innovative tools such as <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>, and the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone">iPhone SDK</a> to create personal and empowering experiences, and believe strongly in incremental improvement and constant feedback.</p>

<p>We place high value in providing elegant solutions, that not only excel technically, but provide a strong foundation for delivering results into the long term.</p>

<p>We believe success is measured not only by building software that works, but by delivering a product that is elegant in design, quality of build, and mindful of scale, performance, and maintenance.</p>

<p>We extensively use test driven development, continuous integration, constantly re-factor and improve upon our code, and follow an incremental and iterative system of adding features while integrating constant feedback, and aren't afraid to adapt to change.</p>

<p>Finally, we believe strongly in delivering a professional result.</p>
