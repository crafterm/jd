  <p class="stand-out">Ruby on Rails transformed the way we
think about building web applications.</p>

  <p>We use <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> because it's an exciting and compelling technology, that allows us to build professional and quality software fast, while remaining nimble to react to change.</p>

  <p>Technically, Ruby's flexible, dynamic and object oriented nature let's us think of solutions that model the real world of our client's domain.</p>

  <p>Like the characteristics of fine red wine, we use a blend of tools to complement our web development services, namely Rails and Sinatra.</p>

  <p>We use <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> because it leverages the power of Ruby and brings it to the web. Rails conventions allow us to start creating immediate value without having to satisfy the requirements
of large frameworks before writing a line of code.</p>

  <p>We use <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> because its light design and compact mindset allows us to build focused web applications and services rapidly.</p>

  <p class="stand-out">The iPhone revolutionised how we think about user experience.</p>

  <p>We use and develop applications for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone</a> simply because we believe it to be the most innovative and compelling mobile device available.</p>

  <p>We're addicted to how intimate and empowering the iPhone user experience can be, and believe the depth of interaction users can have with their iPhones still lies unexplored.</p>

  <p>Technically, we enjoy writing iPhone applications in Objective-C, a language that shares it's Smalltalk heritage with Ruby, and we find the iPhone SDK's rich feature and toolset a joy to use.</p>

  <p>We also find that the iPhone complements the web and excels in providing applications with innovative interfaces for working with online content and consuming web services.</p> </div> <div class="divider"><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
